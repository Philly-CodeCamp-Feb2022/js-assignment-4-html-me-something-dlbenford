            <p><strong>I’M BACK!!!</strong> In 1998, I enrolled in the Golf Academy of the South to learn how to operate
               and manage golf courses and earn my Professional Golfers Association (PGA) certification. Played golf
               with the greats to name a few, Tiger Woods, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Julius Erving, and Negro League
               Player/Manager Buck O’Neal. I also caddied at Bay Hill Golf Course to pay my rent. LOL</p>

            <h1>Saint Louis, Missouri</h1>
            <p>After my stint in Orlando, FL, I was officially a PGA golf pro working at Forest Park as the teaching
               professional. I founded the St. Louis Minority Youth Golf Association (StLMYGA) in 2000. The youth golf
               program was the largest in the city and grew to be notable. StLMYGA merged with the PGA forming the First
               Tee Golf Program located in Forest Park. Proud to be the founder of that program with a legacy I hope
               keeps going. </p>

            <h1>Reading, Pennsylvania</h1>
            <p class="testP">While living in Reading, I worked for Sunoco Logistics, as a pipeline controller. When I
               wasn’t working long twelve hour shifts, I was traveling the east coast taking in every city culture and
               customs. Some of the cities visited includes New York, Philadelphia, Newport, RI, Portland, ME,
               Washington, DC, Atlantic City, NJ, Baltimore, MD. The Reading Pagoda, a historic landmark built in 1908,
               is owned by the City of Reading, Pennsylvania. A symbol of the city for more than a Century, the Pagoda
               is anchored to the mountainside atop the south end of Mount Penn. </p>

            <h1>Saint Louis, Missouri</h1>
            <p>Back in St. Louis, I was privileged to have the honor of working at my old high school Vashon as a Dean
               of students. Touching young minds and seeing them succeed through high school gave me immense pride and
               joy. I worked as a firefighter with the City of St. Louis, and I started my second business venture with
               a bar/restaurant located in South St. Louis named Infinity Blue in honor of my fraternity Phi Beta Sigma.
               Finally I am studying to be a coding assassin with the help of Launchcode experts. After the code camp, I
               hope to represent Launchcode well in the future.</p>
